# Fine-tune-stable-diffusion-using-Lora-on-Pokemon-Dataset

This project fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to generate Pok√©mon-style images based on text prompts. By leveraging the `CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4` model and a custom Pok√©mon-themed dataset, we created a lightweight, efficient model capable of producing highly detailed Pok√©mon-inspired artwork.

## üé® **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to:
1. Fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model using LoRA for Pok√©mon-style image generation.
2. Efficiently adapt pre-trained weights with LoRA, enabling personalized model training without the need for extensive computational resources.
3. Generate unique Pok√©mon-style images from simple textual descriptions.

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Fine-Tuned LoRA Weights**: Efficiently fine-tuned the `UNet` and `CLIPTextEncoder` components of Stable Diffusion using the LoRA method.
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generates high-quality Pok√©mon-inspired images from prompts like "A cute electric type Pok√©mon in a forest."
- **Lightweight Model**: LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, enabling faster training and lower GPU memory usage.
- **Dataset**: Uses a Pok√©mon-themed dataset (`alc15492/pokemonreplica`).
